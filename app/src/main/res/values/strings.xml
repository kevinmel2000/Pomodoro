        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.\n
        There are six steps in the technique:\n
        1. Decide on the task to be done.\n
        2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).\n
        3. Work on the task until the timer rings.\n
        4. After the timer rings put a checkmark on a piece of paper.\n
        5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2. \n
        6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
